## 🚀 About Me
I'm Brandon, my friends call me “Stan” or “Stanly” (my middle name). I'm a Web Developer (Front-End). 🖥️

I'm currently a junior developer with extensive knowledge in web coding and frameworks, I'm practicing almost daily and developing web applications with business approaches for management and logistics, as well as inventory systems with reporting. In relation to the application development I have done, I do Front-End and Back-End work.

I also create web servers and database servers, most of these I do using VMware ESXi to create virtual machines that work for hosting, this using NGINX or APACHE, mostly using Linux Ubuntu Server or any other variant of Linux or OS for hosting or virtualization.
